<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Tejsweeta , a BTech student in Computer Science Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
  at Bennett University. I have a strong interest in learning how machines can think and make decisions, 
  and I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems.

  I am gaining hands-on experience with programming languages like Python, C++, and Java, and I've worked with tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn to build AI and ML models. I enjoy taking on new challenges, whether it’s creating predictive models or exploring new AI techniques.
